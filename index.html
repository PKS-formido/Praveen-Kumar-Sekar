		<h2>  Video Games </h2>

			<p>
			Video Games played a major role in my Life. I even started to upload footages of Fortnite, Apex Legends on youtube. I enjoyed single player games because i felt something is better about them. Video Games were an escape from reality for me. 
			My favorite Single player games are The last Of Us, God Of War, The Unchared Series and Assassin's creed. I would highly recommend you guys to try it. Because of video games I found some of my best friends. Shijo and Theja. They both are from Kerala. Just like Me and My Homie Nithish, they were a duo.
			We then formed a Squad and started to play together all the time.
