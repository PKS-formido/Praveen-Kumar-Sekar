		<h2> <ins> Video Games </ins> </h2>

			<p>
			Video Games played a major role in my Life. I even started to upload footages of Fortnite, Apex Legends on youtube. I enjoyed single player games because i felt something is better about them. Video Games were an escape from reality for me. 
			My favorite Single player games are <sup> The last Of Us, God Of War, The Unchared Series and Assassin's creed </sup>. I would highly recommend you guys to try it. Because of video games I found some of my best friends. Shijo and Theja. They both are from Kerala. Just like Me and My Homie Nithish, they were a duo.
			We then formed a Squad and started to play together all the time.
