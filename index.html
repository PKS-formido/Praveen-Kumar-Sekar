			After 7th std I went to <mark> LEO Mat Hr Sec School </mark>. I did very good in 8th Grade. But after 8th grade I lost interest in studying. My grades dropped from being very good to above average.
			In 10th grade I had lots of fun and my teacher Maxin made Me enjoy school. I was ready to take up My 10th board exams but due to corona, you can say that i escaped. Then came Online classes. I made lots of new friends. When i reached 12th grade, I was still an above average student.

		<h2> <ins> Early days </ins> </h2>

			<p>
			Since my childhood I was very much interested in <b>  Computers </b>. I used to play lots of video games. I liked to involve in outdoor activties too. When others went out of station during their Summer Holidays, I went to school to practice Sprinting.
			My life was like this till i moved to Anna Nagar. After the move, I had to give up Running. I then played video games All day. I used to ride around Anna Nagar in motorbikes with my firnds. We visit Anna Tower every now and then.
			I played Football often too.
			</p>

		<h2> <ins> Video Games </ins> </h2>

			<p>
			Video Games played a major role in my Life. I even started to upload footages of Fortnite, Apex Legends on youtube. I enjoyed single player games because i felt something is better about them. Video Games were an escape from reality for me. 
			My favorite Single player games are <sup> The last Of Us, God Of War, The Unchared Series and Assassin's creed </sup>. I would highly recommend you guys to try it. Because of video games I found some of my best friends. Shijo and Theja. They both are from Kerala. Just like Me and My Homie Nithish, they were a duo.
			We then formed a Squad and started to play together all the time.
